  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">
    App name: <strong>Joy Blast for Joyers</strong><br/>
    Effective date: <strong>[2026-01-15]</strong><br/>
    Developer/Company: <strong>[Joybusinessbay]</strong><br/>
    Contact: <strong>[joybusinessbay@gmail.com]</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Joy Blast for Joyers</strong> (“the App”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the App.
    By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The App itself does not require you to create an account. However, the App uses third-party services (listed below) that may collect information automatically.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device information</strong> (e.g., device model, operating system version, language, region)</li>
    <li><strong>Identifiers</strong> (e.g., advertising identifiers such as IDFA if you allow tracking, and other device identifiers used for analytics/ads/push)</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data</strong> (e.g., app interactions, gameplay events, crash/diagnostic data)</li>
    <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> may be inferred by third parties (e.g., from IP) for advertising/analytics purposes (not precise GPS)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Push Notifications (OneSignal)</h2>
  <p>
    We use <strong>OneSignal</strong> to deliver push notifications (if you opt in).
    OneSignal may collect device identifiers and push tokens required to deliver notifications and measure performance.
    You can disable notifications at any time in your device settings.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
  <p>
    We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to show advertisements. AdMob may collect and process information such as device identifiers, usage data,
    and advertising data to provide and measure ads, including personalized ads where permitted by your settings and local law.
  </p>

  <h2>4. App Tracking Transparency (IDFA)</h2>
  <p>
    On iOS, the App may request permission to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies (via Apple’s
    <strong>App Tracking Transparency</strong> framework). If you allow tracking, the App (and AdMob) may access the device’s advertising identifier (IDFA)
    to deliver and measure personalized ads. If you do not allow tracking, ads may still be shown but may be less relevant.
  </p>

  <h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>
    The App offers In-App Purchases, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Coins</strong> (consumable virtual currency)</li>
    <li><strong>Remove Ads</strong> (non-consumable purchase that disables ads within the App)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Purchases are processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store your payment card details.
    You can restore eligible purchases using the App’s restore purchases option or Apple’s purchase restore mechanisms.
  </p>

  <h2>6. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To operate and improve the App (performance, bug fixes, analytics)</li>
    <li>To deliver push notifications you opt in to</li>
    <li>To display and measure advertisements</li>
    <li>To prevent fraud and ensure security</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>
    We may share information with third-party service providers that help us operate the App, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OneSignal</strong> (push notifications)</li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob / Google</strong> (advertising and measurement)</li>
    <li><strong>Apple</strong> (in-app purchases and App Store services)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These providers may process information according to their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> You can enable/disable push notifications in iOS settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> You can allow/deny tracking when prompted, or change it later in iOS Settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Personalized Ads:</strong> You can limit ad personalization through your device settings where available.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain information only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this policy. Third-party providers may retain data according to their own policies.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction).
    If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
  </p>

  <h2>11. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Your information may be processed in countries other than your own. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards for such transfers.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version on this page and update the effective date.
  </p>
